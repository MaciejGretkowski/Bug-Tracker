Bug Tracker

An issue tracker that will have submit, edit, delete, assign and update features.
This app will support 2 different user types (admin and standard), with different views for both allowing admins to assign a bug to themselves and update the end user via comments. The admin role will be able to see all bugs whereas the user will see bugs only created by themselves. 

Currently in an early stage of development having issues with changing the registration so the user can log in with an email address as well as username. 

Developed using C# ASP .NET CORE 6 API using github as source control, SQL as the database and utilising MVC design pattern.
